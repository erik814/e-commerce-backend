## Description

This program is used to keep track of stock for an online store.

There is no front end associated with this program, but it shows the database and the various routes that have been setup to allow the management of products, categories, and tags.

## Tasks

For this project, I was provided with quite a bit of starter code. My main tasks were to create the models and routes.

## What I Learned

I went into this project with a loose understanding of Insomnia, aswell as express get, post, etc. Part way through the project, much of it clicked for me, which was incredibly helpful!
